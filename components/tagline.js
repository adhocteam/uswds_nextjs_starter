            The tagline should inspire confidence and interest, focusing on the
            value that your overall approach offers to your audience. Use a
            heading typeface and keep your tagline to just a few words, and
            donâ€™t confuse or mystify.

            Use the right side of the grid to explain the tagline a bit more.
